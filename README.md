## Reflection

Even though this took much longer than I hoped, I'm quite proud of how this turned out. I was able to put everything I learned so far about web development to use in this project. Some of the buttons and menus still seem a little clunky but I think I managed to reproduce what I believe is the core functionality of the website. I also really liked using Tailwind for styling together with React.
